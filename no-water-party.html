<section>
    <h2>We know what you're thinking, how do we stop everyone from smelling bad?
  the answer is simple, we only eat vegetables and healthy foods, this way we have an effect
on the bacteria on our bodies. We recognize that this may not be completely fool proof,
luckily we believe noses and human senses will become numbed/adjusted to bad smells</h2>

  alt="Eathelthrith Weiss Rotpanda (Party Leader)">
  Party Leader Eathelthrith Rotpanda may not have a political background, but environmental threats is something
    he knows all too well. As a creature that has lost his habitats and knows of the importance of water
    because he struggles with living in deserts, Rotpanda really cares and has an immense passion environmental stewardship.
    Party Leader Rotpanda is also fluent in chinese and english.
    When it comes to dealing with foreign leaders, would you rather have someone who travels to a different country and
    insist on speaking in english or display cultural respect by speaking in the native language of a foreign official's
    home turf
